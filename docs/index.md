## Quick tour
Consoul enhances the standard console experience in three key ways:

* **Consistent output** – Use `Consoul.Write` and color schemes to produce readable text without littering your code with `Console.ForegroundColor` assignments.
* **Guided input** – Prompt users for validated responses, yes/no confirmations, or structured selections.
* **Composable views** – Organise your menus into reusable classes so that navigation logic stays encapsulated.

The detailed guides contain:

* **When to use it** – Contextual guidance for choosing the feature.
* **Key types** – The APIs involved and how they relate to each other.
* **Minimal example** – A runnable snippet you can paste into your app.
* **Advanced tips** – Configuration options and integration advice.

Continue with the [core console APIs](core-console.md) guide to learn about output helpers, render options, and configuration best practices.
